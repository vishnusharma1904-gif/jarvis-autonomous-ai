Unlike systems that rely on real-time exchange rates from APIs, this project provides the flexibility for users to manually input exchange rates. This ensures usability in offline environments and adaptability for custom exchange rate scenarios.\n\nThe project emphasizes modularity, user-friendliness, and efficiency, showcasing the power of Java in solving real-world problems. It is particularly suited for educational purposes, small businesses, or scenarios where custom rates are preferred.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIntroduction\n\nCurrency conversion is integral to global finance and commerce. For many individuals and businesses, having an accessible tool for manual currency conversion is crucial, especially in offline scenarios or when custom exchange rates are required.\n\nThis project introduces a Currency Converter in Java that allows users to manually input exchange rates. Users can input the source amount, select source\n\nand target currencies, and provide the exchange rate to compute the converted amount. By avoiding reliance on internet connectivity, the tool ensures wider usability. This project demonstrates Java’s capabilities in building efficient, real- world applications.\n\nMODULES\n\nInput Handling\n\nUsers provide the amount, source currency, target currency, and the exchange rate manually.\n\nInput validation ensures proper formats, positive values, and valid options.\n\nExchange Rate Input\n\nAccepts manual entry of exchange rates, offering flexibility for user-defined rates.\n\nValidates the rate to ensure it's a positive value.\n\nConversion Calculation\n\nApplies the formula:\n\nConverted Amount = Source Amount × Exchange Rate\n\nHandles precision using Java's Big Decimal class for accurate results.\n\nOutput Display\n\nDisplays the converted amount in a user-friendly format.\n\nHandles errors like invalid input or incomplete data.\n\nPROJECT

INPUT:\n\nOUTPUT\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis Currency Converter application demonstrates a practical and flexible approach to currency conversion using Java. By allowing manual entry of exchange rates, it ensures that the tool is useful in diverse scenarios, including offline environments or cases requiring custom rates.\n\nFuture Enhancements:\n\nAdding a menu-driven system for multiple conversions in one session.\n\nIncorporating GUI for a more intuitive interface using JavaFX or Swing.\n\nSaving user-entered rates for reuse in future sessions.\n\nAllowing batch conversions for multiple amounts at once.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/\n\nCurrency Conversion Principles",

We import the `sendwhatmsg` function from the `pywhatkit` library.\n2. We define our sender's phone number and recipient's phone number.\n3. We define the message to be sent.\n4. We specify the time at which the message should be sent (in minutes).\n5. Finally, we call the `sendwhatmsg` function with our defined parameters to send the message.\n\n**Note:** Make sure you have WhatsApp installed on your device and have the recipient's phone number saved as a contact in your WhatsApp.\n\nIf you encounter any issues while running this script, here are some common problems and solutions:\n\n* **Error: \"pywhatkit is not installed\"**: Run `pip install pywhatkit` to install the required library.\n* **Error: \"Recipient's phone number is not saved as a contact\"**: Make sure the recipient's phone number is saved as a contact in your WhatsApp.\n* **Error: \"Cannot send message at specified time\"**: Try reducing the time of send by 1-2 minutes and check again.",
